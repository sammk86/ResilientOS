Orchestrating BCMS with resilientos How Rezilens can help you to build a modern Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) with resilientosas its intelligent core.
Enabling Confidence
The Foundational Pillars of a Comprehensive BCMS
A robust BCMS, aligned with standards like ISO 22301, is built upon several critical, interconnected management processes.
Governance & Policy
Establishes leadership commitment, structure,
and policies.
Risk Assessment
Identifies, analyzes, and evaluates threats.
Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Identifies critical functions and determines recovery requirements (RTOs/RPOs).
Continuity Strategy & Planning
Develops strategies and documents procedures (BCPs).
Testing & Exercises
Systematically validates plans to drive
improvement.
Implementation & Deployment
Puts plans into action.
The Disconnect: When Essential Pillars Operate in Isolation
Without a central, dynamic system, pillars become inefficient and outdated.

The Problems
Static, Siloed Data: BIAs in spreadsheets, Risk Registers in other tools— they don't talk.
"Set-and-Forget" Plans: Processes change, but plans are only reviewed annually.
Manual Overhead: Endless cycles of manually collecting data and chasing updates.
Lack of Visibility: Impossible to get a real-time view of resilience posture.
The Solution is A Central Hub
resilientosis the intelligent core that connects every pillar, transforming static documents into a dynamic system.
Single Source of Truth
Centralizes all data (risks, BIAs, plans).
Intelligent Automation
Leverages AI to streamline assessments and analyze data.
Real-Time Visibility
Live dashboards on your resilience posture.

Unifying Governance and Proactive Risk Management
FROM
Disparate policy documents and periodic assessments (static/outdated).
TO
A live, integrated framework where policies map to controls and risks are continuously monitored.
How resilientosPowers This:
Framework Modeling: Map ISO 22301 controls and policies in one place.
Assessment Engine: Dynamic risk assessments with heat maps.

Energizing Business Impact Analysis
FROM
Time-consuming interviews resulting in static reports with outdated RTOs/RPOs.
TO
A dynamic, data-driven process where critical functions are centrally managed.
How resilientosPowers This:
Templates: Customizable templates to identify dependencies.
Centralized Data Model: RTOs/RPOs link directly to continuity plans.

Activating Business Continuity Plans
FROM
100-page PDF plans on a shared drive (impossible to use in a crisis).
TO
Simple, role-based plans accessible on any device.
How resilientosPowers This:
Integrated Documentation: Create BCPs linked to specific risks/teams.
AI Agent System: Query the AI during a crisis for procedures and contact lists.
